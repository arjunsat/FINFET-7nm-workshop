If you observe the graphs we can see that the moores law is still true.
But the performance of the chips are saturating(see the frequency graph)
why?
primarily because we are not ableto cool the systems down in a very efficient manner.
After the release of iphone, a lot of technology was directed the direction of mobile applications.   These devices does not have a very well designed cooling systems. So the power dissipation is less.Hence the frequency is also saturated in the curve.

Digfference between a planr transistor and a finfet
the active channel PROTRUDES up from the SUBSTRATE.	------it liiks like a fin

The gate will straddle around that fin.
Since  the PROTRUDED 
MORE DERIVE CURRENT THAN -----how because of the vertical nature of the non planar devices. You can decouple the electrical width which is the peripheri of the fin in finfet or the nanosheet in gate all around   from the device or substrate
<img width="940" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7136fa3e-e911-4558-93b6-68017932b5b7" />

The gate can control the channel formed on the  top , between S & D .

But in this form structure ther is chance of  sub channel leakage.
where
<img width="795" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abfe8138-5cf7-4c8d-b916-974be50929e1" />

In this region the gate cannot have much control .

How to solve this problem?

By doping this region.
However as the S and D cones closer and closer we need to increase the counter doping correspondingly.

And this increase in doping will lead to another problem --- Band to Band tunneling

because you have highly doped substrate and highly doped drain. So Band to Band tunneling occurs
Band to Band tunneling- leakage between drain and substrate----because of hih doping in drain  and substrate

to prevent this

Perfect ‚Äî that image shows a Double-Gate MOSFET (DG-MOSFET) cross-section.
Let‚Äôs explain everything happening here clearly and physically üëá
________________________________________
‚öôÔ∏è Structure Overview
	S ‚Üí Source
	D ‚Üí Drain
	G ‚Üí Two gates (top and bottom) controlling the same undoped silicon channel
This is a symmetrical double-gate device, meaning both gates can control the channel potential simultaneously.
________________________________________
‚ö° What ‚ÄúTwo Gates Enhance Gate Capacitance‚Äù Means
The gate capacitance (Cox) determines how effectively the gate voltage controls the channel.
In a single-gate MOSFET, the channel is influenced from only one side.
In a double-gate, you have two gates coupling electrostatically with the channel ‚Äî top and bottom ‚Äî so:
C_(ox,eff)=C_(ox,top)+C_(ox,bottom)

‚úÖ Result:
The total gate control over the channel charge doubles, improving electrostatic control, transconductance (gm), and drive current (ID).
________________________________________
üß™ ‚ÄúDrain Capacitance Is Reduced Due to Undoped Channel‚Äù
In short-channel MOSFETs, drain-to-channel capacitance (Cd) causes unwanted coupling ‚Äî called Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL).
By using an undoped channel, we reduce:
	Depletion regions,
	Junction capacitance (since no abrupt p‚Äìn junction),
	Therefore, the drain electric field has less penetration into the channel.
‚úÖ Result:
Less DIBL ‚Üí better short-channel control, less leakage.
________________________________________
üß© ‚ÄúImproves Short-Channel Performance‚Äù
Short-channel effects (SCE) are major issues when transistors shrink:
	Drain field distorts channel potential,
	Threshold voltage roll-off,
	Subthreshold swing worsens.
But here:
	Two gates control the potential tightly from both sides,
	Drain field is screened by strong gate control,
	Hence SCE are suppressed.
‚úÖ Improved metrics:
	Lower subthreshold swing (S),
	Smaller DIBL,
	Better Ion/Ioff ratio.
________________________________________
üìê Formula ‚Äî Subthreshold Swing Relation
S‚àù(1+C_d/C_ox )

Where:
	C_d: depletion capacitance from body/channel
	C_ox: gate oxide capacitance
If C_oxincreases (due to two gates) and C_ddecreases (undoped channel),
‚Üí The ratio C_d/C_oxbecomes very small
‚Üí So S decreases, approaching the ideal 60 mV/dec at room temperature.
________________________________________
‚ö° Summary of What‚Äôs Happening
Feature	Physical Meaning	Benefit
Two gates	Double electrostatic control	Higher drive current, better gm
Undoped channel	Less depletion, lower Cd	Reduced leakage, better SCE
Increased Cox	Stronger gate control	Steeper subthreshold slope
Reduced Cd	Less DIBL, better channel isolation	Stable Vth and lower S

üß© 1. What ‚ÄúHigh-k‚Äù Means
The term k refers to the dielectric constant (relative permittivity, Œµ·µ£) of a material ‚Äî how well it stores electric charge in an electric field.
	Silicon dioxide (SiO‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí k ‚âà 3.9
	High-k materials ‚Üí k ‚â´ 3.9 (typically 10‚Äì25 or more)
Common examples:
Material	Dielectric Constant (k)
SiO‚ÇÇ	3.9
Si‚ÇÉN‚ÇÑ	7
Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ	9
HfO‚ÇÇ	20‚Äì25
ZrO‚ÇÇ	22‚Äì25
TiO‚ÇÇ	40‚Äì80 (less stable for CMOS)
________________________________________
‚öôÔ∏è 2. Why High-k Materials Are Used
As transistors scaled down, the gate oxide thickness (T‚Çí‚Çì) needed to decrease to maintain strong electrostatic control.
However:
	Thinner SiO‚ÇÇ ‚Üí huge leakage current due to quantum tunneling.
	This causes power waste and device heating.
So, instead of using thinner SiO‚ÇÇ, engineers replaced it with a thicker layer of high-k material that gives the same capacitance but less leakage.
________________________________________
‚ö° 3. Gate Capacitance Relation
C_ox=(Œµ_0 Œµ_r)/t_ox 

To get the same Cox, we can use:
	High Œµ·µ£ (dielectric constant)
	Larger t‚Çí‚Çì
That‚Äôs the key idea:
High-k dielectric = thick physical oxide with thin electrical equivalent (EOT).
________________________________________
Equivalent Oxide Thickness (EOT)
EOT=t_(high-k)√ó3.9/k_(high-k) 

So for HfO‚ÇÇ (k‚âà20), a 2 nm layer gives:
EOT=2√ó3.9/20=0.39" nm (effective like ultra-thin SiO‚ÇÇ!)"

‚úÖ Thus:
	Same gate control,
	Far less tunneling leakage.
________________________________________
üß† 4. Benefits
Parameter	With SiO‚ÇÇ	With High-k
Leakage current	Very high (thin oxide)	Much lower
Gate capacitance	Decreases as Tox ‚Üì	Maintained high
Drive current	Limited	Increases (better control)
Reliability	Poor (tunneling)	Improved
Scaling	Limited below ~1.2 nm	Enabled < 1 nm EOT nodes
________________________________________
‚ö° 5. Challenges
High-k materials are not perfect ‚Äî they introduce new problems:
	Interface traps: poor bonding with Si ‚Üí degraded mobility.
	Fixed charges: shift threshold voltage (Vth).
	Thermal stability: high-k materials can crystallize at high temps.
	Need for metal gates: polysilicon + high-k causes Fermi-level pinning ‚Üí metal gate replaces poly-Si.
Hence the modern High-k / Metal Gate (HKMG) stack.

how the drive current increases

Excellent question ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step by step so you can physically understand how the drive current increases when we ‚Äúdecouple electrical width from device area.‚Äù
________________________________________
‚ö° 1. Drive Current in a MOSFET (Basic Equation)
In the saturation region, the drain current of a MOSFET is roughly:
I_Dsat=1/2 ŒºC_ox  W/L(V_GS-V_th )^2

Where:
	Œº: carrier mobility
	C_ox: oxide capacitance per unit area
	W: channel width
	L: channel length
	V_GS-V_th: effective gate overdrive voltage
So ‚Üí ID ‚àù W, i.e., a wider channel = more current.
________________________________________
üß± 2. In Planar MOSFETs ‚Äî Width = Physical Width
If you double the gate width (say from 1 ¬µm to 2 ¬µm), you physically make the device twice as wide.
‚Üí This doubles the current, but also doubles the layout area and capacitance.
________________________________________
üèóÔ∏è 3. In FinFETs ‚Äî Vertical Stacking Adds Width Without Area Growth
In a FinFET, current flows along the sides and top of a raised fin.
Each fin contributes an effective electrical width:
W_eff=2H_fin+W_fin

If you add more fins, total effective width becomes:
W_(eff,total)=N_fin (2H_fin+W_fin)

‚úÖ But note:
Fins are spaced tightly in the vertical direction, so adding fins doesn‚Äôt increase lateral area linearly like planar MOSFETs.
‚Üí You get more total channel per unit footprint.
Thus, ID increases (‚àù W_eff) without large area penalty.
________________________________________
üß¨ 4. In Nanosheet / Forksheet FETs ‚Äî Vertical Sheets Multiply Conduction Paths
In nanosheet or forksheet FETs, the current flows around multiple stacked horizontal channels, fully surrounded by the gate (GAA).
If you have N sheets, each with width W_sheet:
W_(eff,total)=N√óW_sheet

‚Üí Drive current increases proportionally to the number of sheets, even though the footprint area barely changes.
That‚Äôs how the electrical width (and hence drive current) increases ‚Äî you‚Äôve added more conduction surfaces (more channels) per unit footprint.
________________________________________
üîç 5. Physical Intuition
Think of it like adding more lanes to a highway stacked vertically ‚Äî each lane carries current, but you‚Äôre not widening the road; you‚Äôre stacking them up.
‚Üí More carriers flow in parallel ‚Üí higher drive current.
‚Üí But same footprint area ‚Üí higher current density.
________________________________________
‚ö° Summary Table
Device Type	Current Path	How ID Increases	Area Impact
Planar MOSFET	1 channel on surface	Increase W (lateral)	Large
FinFET	Current on fin sidewalls + top	Add more fins (vertical width)	Small
Nanosheet / Forksheet	Fully-gated stacked sheets	Add more sheets (stacked vertically)	Very small
________________________________________
So, when you decouple electrical width from device area, you‚Äôre increasing the number of active conduction channels per footprint ‚Äî that‚Äôs why drive current increases while maintaining compact chip area.
Would you like me to show this concept visually (with a comparison diagram of current paths in planar vs FinFET vs nanosheet)?



CONSTANT ELECTRIC FIELD SCALING‚Äîvoltage scalingAs semiconductor technology advances, traditional planar transistors face severe limits in electrostatics, leakage, and scaling efficiency.

Undoped channels lower drain capacitance and improve subthreshold swing (approaching 60 mV/dec).

4. High-k / Metal Gate Stack (HKMG)

Replaces thin SiO‚ÇÇ to reduce gate leakage while maintaining high capacitance.

Common materials: HfO‚ÇÇ (k‚âà20), ZrO‚ÇÇ, Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ with TiN or W metal gates.

Benefits: lower tunneling current, improved drive current, and continued EOT scaling.

5. Channel & Material Innovations

SiGe and other high-mobility materials used for < 5 nm nodes.

‚ö° Device Concepts and Phenomena
Constant-Field Scaling

Voltage scaling accompanies geometry reduction to maintain electric field consistency.

Drive Current Enhancement

FinFETs decouple electrical width from area ‚Äî stacking fins/sheets increases conduction paths.
