# FINFET-7nm-workshop
ðŸ§  FinFET Circuit Design & Characterization @ 7 nm

This repository presents my completed work from the FinFET Circuit Design and Characterization Workshop, where I successfully implemented and verified multiple 7 nm circuit designs using Xschem, Ngspice, and the ASAP7 predictive PDK.

Throughout this workshop, I conducted comprehensive device-level characterization of NFETs and PFETs, designed and simulated a FinFET inverter, and implemented a 7 nm bandgap reference circuit. Each project was executed using reproducible netlists, automated measurement scripts, and benchmarked plots to ensure accuracy and traceability.

The results include complete Idâ€“Vd and Idâ€“Vg characteristics, extracted gm and ro parameters, inverter voltage transfer curves, and bandgap output analysis covering line/load regulation and temperature stability. All deliverables are organized and documented in a clean, version-controlled format reflecting professional analog design workflows.
